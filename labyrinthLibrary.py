# this library contains the Labyrinth class
#
# a Labyrinth has a bunch of attributes directly taken from the save file :
# name (string)
# author (string)
# colors : dictionary binding color ID (0 to 3) to a list of 6 RGB values between 0 and 1000 (three for the foreground, two for the background, one to keep people asking)
# highscores : list of [score:int, player:string] couples
# nextLevel : filename for the level to follow (the game asks if you want to go to the next level at the end of the current one)
# levelMap : a rectangular, 2D table representing the level with 0, 1, 2 and 3s

# Plus some stuff :
# levelSizeX and levelSizeY = two ints representing the map at its largest
# writeComment = a string written as a comment when the labyrinth is saved

# Methods :
# default constructor : returns a sample labyrinth
# constructor with (fileName) argument : reads <fileName> and returns the resulting labyrinth, or False if it couldn't be read
# write(fileName) : writes the Labyrinth as <fileName>

 User's manual
===============

Launch the program with "python3 labyrinth.py" or simply "./labyrinth.py" when you're in the right folder. You do need the version 3 of python installed.

** Playing the game

Simply use the arrow keys to control the "x" representing your character. You can use the "Q" key to quit when playing, or just Ctrl+C.

Your goal is to reach the red square (or one of them, if there's more than one) ; you can't go through white squares ("walls").

** Game parameters

You can load levels in this game ! Simply write the path to the level file after the program when launching the game. A few levels are bundled with this game, but you can create your own.

Alternatively, you can call the game with the "-h" option : this will print a short help and exit.

** Creating levels

This game does not come bundled with a level editor yet. However, this doesn't prevent you from creating your own levels.

This game comes bundled with ".laby" files representing levels ; they are actually simple text files written with a special format.

The files only contain a grid of "0", "1", "2" and "3" : the "0" represent squares the player can go through, the "1" represent white squares (walls) the player can't pass. A "2" case is a target square : if the player reaches one of these, he wins the game. Finally, "3" is where the player spawns.

When the game processes the levels, it takes every "2" into account, but only the first "3" it sees ; so you can only have one spawn point (other spawn points will still appear blue in game, but the player won't spawn on them). If there is no "3" square in the level file, the game will pick the last "0" case it read from the file as spawn point.

Although this hasn't been tested, levels in theory don't have to be rectangular. But it is much easier to create a grid of "0" and work from there, hence why this hasn't been tested.

** Level generator

Additionally, this game comes bundled with a level generator ; this program will generate rough but playable, rectangular levels. Nothing is stopping you from using an automatically generated level as a base for your own levels.

To use the level generator, simply execute levelGenerator.py as you would the game ; without any arguments, it will generate a 20*20 level and save it as "a.laby".

You can use arguments to set height, width, and output file name. You can also set the seed for the random generator ; this means that if you give the generator the same width, height and seed to work with twice, it will output the exact same level. Hence, you could share a level your particularly liked with your friends as "the 50*80 level with 'gargamel' as seed".

For concise and comprehensive list of options use the "help" argument.  


 Meddler's guide
=================

** Rebinding keys

Keys can fairly easily be rebound, as key input is only managed in one place. Simply find the appropriate piece of code (search for "curses.KEY_LEFT", for instance) and rebind the keys as you wish.

Two things to take into consideration : first, the game expects a character, so "w" (a string) won't work whereas ord("w") (a character from a string) will ; second, keep in mind it's fairly common to hit the capslock key when playing.


** Changing the player character

The "character" defaults to a "x", but you can change this to whatever you like. Search for the first occurence of "playerCharacter" and change what it corresponds to.



 Developer's guide
===================

It's hard to write to stdout when inside ncurses, so this program does :

execute errorOutput
 -> which executes curses.wrapper(main), expecting a returned value
   -> which sets up curses and runs main(), returning what it returns
     -> which returns things only on errors

This game uses ncurses. It draws a title window and a pad beneath it, and enters a loop where it waits for user input to continue (ie, process the consequences of the input and refresh the display, before waiting again).


** Limitations to consider

Although using a pad made the game quite flexible to resizes, the title screen and game over window are not as lenient. For now, the entire game needs ~30 characters of wideness : should we work on this ?


** level generator

How the generator works :

1. generate a table full of 1s

2. designate semi-randomly starting and ending positions (they are always opposite to one another)

3. Repeatedly "take steps" (ie write 0s) in direction of the objective, with a chance not to go in the right direction for added randomness
3bis. If this takes too long, switch of the "go in the wrong direction" part and keep going straight for the objective. This writes a message to stderr.
3ter. If this still takes too long, break out of the loop and go to 4. This also writes a message to stderr.

4. Pick squares at random. If they're 1s, overwrite them with a 0.

5. Write resulting table to disk
